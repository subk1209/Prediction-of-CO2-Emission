Prediction of CO2 Emission using Multiple Linear Regression

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)on the dataset with attributes and 7300+ instances(usedggplot2in R)
Implemented log transformation on the response variable and the necessary numerical covariates to normalize the data
Diagnosed multicollinearity present in the data and excluded the variables having highest Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
Fitted a Multiple Linear Regression model on the train data and arrived at an Adjusted score of 89.18% on the test data
